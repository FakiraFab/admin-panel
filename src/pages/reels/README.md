# Reels Management System

This directory contains the complete reels management system for the admin panel, following the same patterns and design consistency as the existing categories, subcategories, and banners components.

## Components

### 1. ReelsList.tsx
- **Purpose**: Main listing page for all reels with pagination
- **Features**:
  - Displays reels in a table format with thumbnail, title, description, order, status, and creation date
  - Pagination support with smooth scrolling
  - Inline editing with modal popup
  - Toggle visibility (activate/deactivate) functionality
  - Delete confirmation with toast notifications
  - Loading states and error handling
  - Responsive design with hover effects

### 2. AddReel.tsx
- **Purpose**: Form to create new reels
- **Features**:
  - Form validation for required fields (title, video URL)
  - Image preview for thumbnail URLs
  - Radio buttons for active/inactive status
  - Number input for display order
  - Success/error toast notifications
  - Navigation back to reels list on success

### 3. EditReel.tsx
- **Purpose**: Modal component for editing existing reels
- **Features**:
  - Pre-populated form with existing reel data
  - Same validation and UI as AddReel
  - Modal overlay with close button
  - Real-time form updates
  - Optimistic updates with query invalidation

### 4. DeleteReel.ts
- **Purpose**: Utility function for deleting reels
- **Features**:
  - Axios DELETE request to backend
  - Consistent error handling

## API Integration

The reels system integrates with the following backend endpoints:

- `GET /reels` - Fetch paginated reels list
- `POST /reels` - Create new reel
- `PATCH /reels/:id` - Update existing reel
- `DELETE /reels/:id` - Delete reel
- `PATCH /reels/:id/toggle-visibility` - Toggle reel visibility

## Design Consistency

The reels management system maintains consistency with the existing project theme:

### UI/UX Features:
- **Color Scheme**: Uses the same blue (#1c1c1c) for headings and consistent gray tones
- **Typography**: Consistent font weights and sizes
- **Spacing**: Uniform padding and margins following the design system
- **Components**: Reuses existing UI components (Card, Input, Textarea, etc.)
- **Interactions**: Hover effects, transitions, and loading states
- **Responsive**: Mobile-friendly table layout with horizontal scrolling

### Error Handling:
- **Toast Notifications**: Consistent success, error, and confirmation messages
- **Loading States**: Spinner animations during API calls
- **Validation**: Client-side form validation with user-friendly error messages
- **Fallbacks**: Graceful handling of missing images and data

### State Management:
- **React Query**: Efficient caching and background updates
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI feedback for better UX
- **Query Invalidation**: Automatic data refresh after mutations

## Navigation Integration

The reels system is integrated into the main navigation:

- **Sidebar**: Added "Reels" section with VideoIcon
- **Routes**: `/reels` for listing and `/reels/add` for creation
- **Breadcrumbs**: Consistent navigation flow

## Features Overview

### Core Functionality:
1. **CRUD Operations**: Complete Create, Read, Update, Delete functionality
2. **Pagination**: Efficient loading of large datasets
3. **Search & Filter**: Ready for future implementation
4. **Bulk Operations**: Extensible for future bulk actions

### Advanced Features:
1. **Visibility Toggle**: Quick activate/deactivate without full edit
2. **Order Management**: Display order for custom sorting
3. **Image Preview**: Thumbnail preview in forms
4. **Status Indicators**: Visual status badges in the table

### User Experience:
1. **Confirmation Dialogs**: Safe delete operations
2. **Form Validation**: Real-time validation feedback
3. **Loading States**: Clear feedback during operations
4. **Error Recovery**: Graceful error handling and retry options

## Future Enhancements

The system is designed to be easily extensible for:

1. **Bulk Operations**: Select multiple reels for batch actions
2. **Advanced Filtering**: Filter by status, date range, etc.
3. **Drag & Drop**: Reorder reels with drag and drop
4. **Video Preview**: Embedded video player in the table
5. **Analytics**: View counts and engagement metrics
6. **Categories**: Organize reels by categories or tags

## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies:
- React Query for data fetching and caching
- Lucide React for icons
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Axios for HTTP requests

### File Structure:
```
src/pages/reels/
├── ReelsList.tsx      # Main listing component
├── AddReel.tsx        # Create new reel form
├── EditReel.tsx       # Edit reel modal
├── DeleteReel.ts      # Delete utility function
└── README.md          # This documentation
```

### Key Patterns:
- **Component Composition**: Reusable UI components
- **Custom Hooks**: Potential for extracting reusable logic
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript interfaces for data structures
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling
- **Performance**: Optimized re-renders and data fetching

This implementation provides a complete, production-ready reels management system that seamlessly integrates with the existing admin panel architecture.
